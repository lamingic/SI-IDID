**Introduction：**：SI-IDID represents an innovative extension of the established Ev-IDID toolkit~(please refer to https://github.com/lamingic/Ev-IDID), specifically tailored to address complex I-DID (Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram) problems with enhanced precision and capabilities. Building upon the solid foundation laid by Ev-IDID, SI-IDID refines and augments its predecessor's functionalities, offering a superior approach to I-DID modeling.

Furthermore, the repository functions as supplementary material for our paper titled "Improved Response Strategies for Unknown Behaviours in Multiagent Interaction," authored by an esteemed team comprising Yinghui Pan (Member, IEEE), Mengen Zhou, Yifeng Zeng (Member, IEEE), Biyang Ma (Member, IEEE), Yew-soon Ong (Fellow, IEEE), and Guoquan Liu.

**Abstract：**： Within this paper, we harness two distinct simulation intelligence (SI) techniques to devise innovative behaviors for interacting agents, thereby empowering the subject agent to optimize its response strategies. These novel behaviors are designed to accurately mirror the authentic behaviors of other agents, enabling the subject agent to react appropriately and effectively. By leveraging the Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams framework, we undertake a theoretical analysis to explore how these algorithms impact the decision quality of the subject agent. Additionally, we empirically validate the performance of these algorithms across two widely recognized problem domains, showcasing their robustness and applicability.
