This repository serves as supplemental material for our paper titled "Improved Response Strategies for Unknown Behaviours in Multiagent Interaction," authored by Yinghui Pan (Member, IEEE), Mengen Zhou, Yifeng Zeng (Member, IEEE), Biyang Ma (Member, IEEE), Yew-soon Ong (Fellow, IEEE), and Guoquan Liu. 

It encompasses data, code, figures, tables, photos, simulation results, analysis, and experiment setups. In this article, we employ two distinct SI techniques to devise novel behaviors for other agents, enabling the subject agent to optimize its response strategies. These new behaviors aim to accurately reflect the true behaviors of other agents, thereby allowing the subject agent to react appropriately. Utilizing a general multiagent decision framework known as Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams, we conduct a theoretical analysis of how these two algorithms affect the subject agent's decision quality. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the performance of these algorithms in two well-established problem domains.
